Azure Private Endpoint
Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. The service could be an Azure service such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, SQL, etc. or your own Private Link Service.

Network security of private endpoints
When using private endpoints for Azure services, traffic is secured to a specific private link resource. The platform performs an access control to validate network connections reaching only the specified private link resource. To access additional resources within the same Azure service, additional private endpoints are required.
You can completely lock down your workloads from accessing public endpoints to connect to a supported Azure service. This control provides an additional network security layer to your resources by providing a built-in exfiltration protection that prevents access to other resources hosted on the same Azure service.
