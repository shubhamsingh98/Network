1)Virtual Network
Virtual Network in Azure is free of charge. Every subscription is allowed to create up to 50 Virtual Networks across all regions.

VNET Peering links two virtual networks â€“ either in the same region or in different regions - and enables you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. Inbound and outbound traffic is charged at both ends of the peered networks.

1.1)Same Region:
Sample- 100GB data: -Outbound data transfer:100Gb* $0.0100/Gb    =$1.00
                    -Inbound data transfer:100Gb* $0.0100/Gb    =$1.00

Total Monthly Cost = $2.00

1.2)For across region it would around(monthly) !2.50(for same congiguration)


2)VPN Gateway
Gateway Type: Basic VPN
720 gateway hours (1 month) = $25.92

Inbound Inter-virtual: Free =$0.00
Outbound Inter-VNET data transfers: For 100 Gb = $7.60
