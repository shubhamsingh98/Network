
Azure Private Endpoint

Azure Private Endpoint is basically a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.
- To access resources privately.
- Private end point provides us with a Private Ip and we put that Private Ip into DNS Server and then with that Ip we can access azure resources privately.
- It uses private IP address from attached VNet.
- By this it brings Azure service into attached VNet.

Network security of private endpoints:
Private endpoints secure the traffic to a specific private link resource.
And for validation of network connections reaching only to specific private link resource an access control is performed.
To access additional resources within our same Azure service, additional private endpoints are required.
In order to gain additional network security layer we can completely restrict workloads from accessing public endpoints to connect to a supported Azure service(i.e. by providing a built-in exfiltration protection).

Stream analytics
Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine.It is designed to analyze and process high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously.
-It basically function on Nucor as Stream Analytics ingests data from IoT Hub (in NCFNE subscription) and will send Output to connected Power Bi, by the help of a specific query triggered on Stream Analytics.

Security
-It encrypts all incoming and outgoing communications and supports TLS 1.2.
-The Built-in checkpoints are also encrypted.
-Incoming Data is not stored as processing takes place in-memory.
-VNET are supported in a Stream Analytics Cluster (dedicated deployment required).

2.4. Azure Key Vault
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is basically that entity or value which we want to hide from general reach.
Two types of containers are supported:- vaults : supports storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates.
                                      - managed hardware security module(HSM) pools : supports HSM-backed keys.

Encryption of data in transit: TLS & PFS.

Azure Key Vault would be used as to secure production device certificates and keys.

Power Bi

Power BI is a Business Intelligence and Data Visualization tool for converting data from various data sources into interactive dashboards and analysis reports.

It would be reciving data from our Stream Analytics(in NCFNE Subscription) and we would be
